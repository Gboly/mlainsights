      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">The Invisible Barriers Around Money</h2>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#334155;">
        For generations, women have been socialized to be cautious around money — to save quietly, avoid risk, or let someone else “handle the financial talk.” These unspoken rules create invisible barriers that follow many women into adulthood, careers, and negotiations. But the narrative is changing. Women are building companies, leading investment decisions, and shaping economic outcomes — and ownership begins with confident financial communication.

      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">Why Claiming Space Matters</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        Money is more than mathematics — it’s a language. And those who speak it confidently shape how they are valued. When women communicate clearly about their financial goals, worth, and expectations, they shift the power dynamic and make room for stronger opportunities.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin:8px 0 0 20px; color:#334155;">
        <li>Clarity creates authority</li>
        <li>Confidence strengthens negotiation</li>
        <li>Visibility invites opportunity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">The Wealth Confidence Framework</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        Financial confidence grows when knowledge, mindset, and communication merge. Women don’t need to know everything about money to lead — they need alignment between what they understand, how they think about it, and how they express it.
      </p>
      <ol style="margin:8px 0 0 20px; color:#334155;">
        <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Understanding the basics of money, value, and opportunity.</li>
        <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> Rewriting beliefs shaped by early financial experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Asking questions, stating worth, and expressing goals with clarity.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">Leading Financial Conversations</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        Leadership in finance isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room — it’s about confidence, perspective, and intention. When women bring clarity to the table, they elevate conversations and open new paths for themselves and others.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin:8px 0 0 20px; color:#334155;">
        <li>Ask direct financial questions</li>
        <li>Negotiate with data, not apology</li>
        <li>State goals without shrinking</li>
        <li>Speak with the assumption that your perspective matters</li>
      </ul>

    <section style="padding: 1.5rem 0">
      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">Wealth Through Authenticity</h2>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#334155;">
        Women don’t need to mimic traditional financial behavior to succeed. Authentic financial communication — asking thoughtful questions, seeking clarity, and making intentional decisions — builds trust and opens doors. When women express themselves honestly, they reshape what financial leadership looks like.

      <p style="margin:0 0 6px;">
        <strong>Final thought:</strong> Women don’t just participate in financial systems — they redefine them. When women speak clearly about money, they gain power, influence, and the freedom to build wealth on their own terms.
