      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">The Money Stories We Carry</h2>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#334155;">
        Every adult has a financial mindset — but most people never realize it was written long before they ever earned their first paycheck. Our money stories come from childhood moments, cultural expectations, family struggles, and the emotional lessons we absorbed without even noticing.

      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">Where These Stories Begin</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        Some of us grew up hearing “money doesn’t grow on trees,” while others heard “just work hard and everything will be fine.” Some saw abundance, others saw scarcity. Some watched parents argue about bills; others watched them quietly carry financial stress.
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        These early experiences shape beliefs that follow us into adulthood:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin:8px 0 0 20px; color:#334155;">
        <li>Whether we feel safe earning or spending</li>
        <li>How much we think we deserve</li>
        <li>Whether we take financial risks or avoid them</li>
        <li>How we define success, stability, or security</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">When Stories Become Patterns</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        The problem isn’t the story — it’s when the story becomes automatic.  
        Many adults struggle with saving, overspending, undercharging for their work, or feeling anxious around money without understanding why.  
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0; color:#334155;">
        These aren’t “bad habits.” They’re old survival patterns trying to protect us based on outdated experiences.

      <h2 style="font-size:18px; margin:0 0 8px; color:#0b2545;">Rewriting Your Money Story</h2>
      <p style="margin:0 0 8px; color:#334155;">
        The good news: a money story is not a life sentence.  
        Like any narrative, it can be rewritten — with awareness, intention, and a willingness to challenge the beliefs you inherited, not the ones you chose.
      </p>
      <ol style="margin:8px 0 0 20px; color:#334155;">
        <li><strong>Identify the original story:</strong> What did you grow up hearing or seeing about money?</li>
        <li><strong>Notice how it affects you today:</strong> What behaviors or fears trace back to that story?</li>
        <li><strong>Introduce a new narrative:</strong> Replace emotional reactions with conscious decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice new habits:</strong> Confidence grows from small, consistent shifts.</li>
      </ol>

        <strong>Final thought:</strong> You didn’t choose your first money story — but you can choose the one you live by now. When you rewrite your financial narrative, you don’t just change your habits; you change your future.
